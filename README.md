Welcome to the booksmanager frontend!

```docker-compose up -d``` to run the application.

An initial .env configuration should be:

```
VITE_GRAPHQL_URI=http://localhost:8080/graphql
```

I was doing it while doing my backend and forgot to commiting all my changes during the development ðŸ˜©.
I'm not the best on front end and it was what took more time than everything for me on this weekend... so I just tried to use what the community is using at the moment **like** vite (which I also prefer) and **shadcn** for components.
